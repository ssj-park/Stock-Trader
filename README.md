# CS50 Finance Stock Trader

## Project Overview
This project is part of Harvard's [CS50x 2024](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) course, designed to implement a stock trading web application. The application allows users to create and manage a virtual stock portfolio. Users can register, log in, and perform actions typical in stock trading, such as buying, selling, and viewing real-time quotes. The project utilizes Python, Flask, SQLite, and the IEX API to deliver stock data and handle application logic.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a simulated environment for stock trading, helping users understand how stock markets operate and how they can manage a portfolio. Through this simulation, users gain exposure to financial principles, including stock valuation, portfolio management, and transaction logging.

## Main Features
1. **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login functionality allowing each user to have a personalized account and portfolio.
2. **Buying Stocks**: Users can search for a stock by symbol, view the current price, and purchase shares using their virtual cash balance.
3. **Selling Stocks**: Users can view the stocks they own and sell shares to adjust their portfolio as needed.
4. **Portfolio Management**: Displays a comprehensive view of the user's financial holdings, including current cash balance, stock holdings, and the overall value of their portfolio.
5. **Transaction History**: Keeps a detailed log of all transactions (buys and sells) for reference, allowing users to track their trading history.
6. **Real-Time Stock Quotes**: Retrieves live stock price data through the IEX API, enabling users to make informed trading decisions based on up-to-date information.
